The basic idea of this project is that I will be exploring the idea of finding The Edge of the World. This narrative will begin with a traveler walking across some material (current walking sound effect is a placeholder- I will record my own soon). Wind begins to pick up (I'll have this fade in, instead of the sudden start it has now). The traveler will walk for a bit longer, then stop. A few seconds pass, then a creaky door can be heard from the right. This is where I will have dialogue between the traveler and an old woman who lives in a hut at The Edge of the World. I have the basic idea of the script, but haven't written it yet. At some point in the conversation, the traveler will ask what lies beyond this place, to which the old woman will reply something to the effect of, "nothing but a vast sea of emptiness," which is when the waves sound effect will play. Their conversation will be cut short by the sound of a tea kettle coming from the old woman's hut, after which she will invite the traveler inside for a cup of tea.
I am going for a slow-paced, minimalistic, and atmospheric approach to this project. Currently the audio tracks are quite unbalanced and too close together- I plan to space things out more once I have the dialogue recorded. I also have been thinking about continuing with the idea of this location being malleable to language, like when the sounds of waves can be heard when the old woman says that there is nothing but a vast sea of emptiness beyond. 
Some dialogue ideas:
OW: What are you doing here traveler? There is nothing here for you.
T: This is where the road I followed led me.
OW: All roads lead here. All roads end here. 
T: What are you doing out here? Surely this is no place for one of your age.
OW: I am waiting.
T: Waiting for what?
OW: *chuckles*
T: What lies beyond this place?
OW: Nothing but a vast sea of emptiness.
